<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This movie is beautifully made. One of the few anime movies I can watch at any time.</p>

<h3>LaLa Land</h3>
<p>The music, the dancing, the acting, the production, the drama. In my opinion, there is absolutely no other movie like it.</p>

<h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>My favorite Disney movie of all time.</p>
